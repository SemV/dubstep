Dubstep

This website is dedicated to my love for dubstep, the electronic music genre.

UX

The purpose of this website is to showcase some of my favourite artists and tracks in the hope that people will discover a new genre they like. The website is mostly set out to entertain the audience. 
A user should be able to:
- View artists
- Listen to music
- View events
- Contact me

Features

Navigation bar - allows users to browse through the sections of the website.
Soundcloud links - allows users to listen to my favourite tracks.
Youtube links - allows users to see videos of events.
Contact form - allows users to contact me by filling out a form.

Features Left to Implement

I think it would be cool if you could click on an artist cover and it would turn around, presenting a soundcloud (or other) iframe where you can listen the track.
Some animations in or around the site heading could also be cool. Maybe even some sort of visual equalizer that is reacting to the music.

Technologies used

- Bootstrap 4.3.1 for the grid system.
- jQuery for 3.4.0 for the cascading navbar in mobile view.
- Font awesome 5.7.2 for the social media buttons in the footer.
- Google font for the Montserrat font.

Testing

I tested the website using mainly google chrome (v75.0) developer tools on Windows at 1440p and lower resolutions. The following browsers were also used: Firefox Quantum v67.0, Internet Explorer 11, Safari v12.1.1, Microsoft Edge
I also used my galaxy S8 and an iPhone 6 to make sure the developer tools are not lying to me.
Concerning bugs, I had some but I think (hope) I fixed them all.
